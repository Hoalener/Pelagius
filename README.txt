A brand new primitive catholic heresy for CK2 !

The Breton monk Pelagius insisted on man's free will and the non necessary characteristic of divine grace to reach salvation. Denying the original sin, his doctrine was fought by Augustin of Hippone and declared heretic in 418. However it will continue to feed theological debates for many centuries.

If the Pentarchy is restored and Pelagianism becomes mainstream, the Great Schism could be mended. Pelagian court chaplains and patriarchs should be bishops or monks.

Since Pelagianism predates all other catholic heresies in CK2, it is possible to convert from any catholic/pelagian holy site.

Languages : English and French
Note : version 1.0 for CK2 version 2.7.2.0
